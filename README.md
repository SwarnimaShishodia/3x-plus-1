# 3x-Plus-1

3x-Plus-1 is a lagorithm of encryption which uses the famous 3x+1 maths problem for solving the encryption problem. It is used the find the highest no where the 3x+1 calculator can reach and at which points based on the no of characters. 

After finding the highest Possible no and no of steps to reach the no it can be used in two ways, either be used as salt with sha256 Password or can also be used as sha56( sha56(password) + sha56(highestPossible) + sha56(highestPoint) ).

I am using the other solution.
